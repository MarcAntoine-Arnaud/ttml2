<p>This is the Second <loc href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#candidate-rec">Candidate Recommendation</loc> (CR2) of
the Second Edition of the Timed Text Markup Language &versionOfTT; (TTML&versionOfTT;), and is expected to advance to Proposed
Recommendation no earlier than 30 March 2021.
This Second <loc href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#candidate-rec">Candidate Recommendation</loc> (CR2) makes no
technical changes to the previous, First <loc href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#candidate-rec">Candidate
Recommendation</loc> (CR1); that is, only editorial (non-substantive) changes were applied.</p>

<p>For this specification to exit CR, the following criterion must be met: for each feature (extension) affected by a substantive
change introduced by this specification, at least two independent implementations must support the feature (extension) having been
so affected. No (underlying) feature (extension) has been added or removed by this revision, and, as such, no feature
(extension) is marked at risk.</p>

<p>An <loc href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML2SecondEditionImplementationReport">implementation report</loc>
will be provided.  A summary of technical changes from TTML2, 1st Edition, is available
